# Classifier

This directory contains a pickled version of our final classifier and other files needed to transform new data such that they can be classified.

You can run the classifier on the sample data (a set of Donald Trump's tweets)
using the following command:
```python2 classifier.py```

The progress of the classifier will be output in the shell, followed by each tweet and its predicted category.

You can also run the classifier on any other dataset but simply modifying the inputs in lines 209 and 210.
